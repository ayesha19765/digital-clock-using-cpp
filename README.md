# Ayesha's Digital Clock

## Project Overview:

This C++ project implements a simple digital clock that continuously displays the current time. The program utilizes the `<iostream>` and `<ctime>` headers to handle input and time-related functions. It features a loop that keeps updating and displaying the time until manually terminated.

## Features:

- Continuous display of the current time.
- Utilizes the `<ctime>` library to fetch and display time information.

## How to Run:

1. Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
   ```bash
   g++ digital_clock.cpp -o digital_clock
   ```

2. Run the compiled executable.
   ```bash
   ./digital_clock
   ```

## System Compatibility:

- The program uses system-specific commands to clear the console screen. The current implementation works on Unix/Linux systems. For Windows compatibility, the code uses conditional compilation.

## Additional Notes:

- The program utilizes an infinite loop (`while(1)`) to continuously update and display the time. To exit the program, manually terminate the execution.
